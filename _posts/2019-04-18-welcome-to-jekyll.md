Today we'll now be examining an example of Javascript syntax. Here is how to produce a basic recursive function:
```js
function recursion() {
    // blah blah
    recursion();
    // blah
}

recursion();
```
We'd like to ask whether Javascript is a religion. We'd also like to ask if Javascript has a religion. If so, would it be recursion?
It might take time for us to answer these, but perhaps we will.
